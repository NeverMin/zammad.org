If you're a Gmail user, you'll appreciate a new shortcut we've added to your inbox. Now when you receive a Zammad notification email, you'll see a small "View on Zammad" button on the right of the subject line. Click that button and you'll be taken directly to the Zammad ticket, without having to open the email.

We hope this small addition saves you a few clicks a day and makes your life with Zammad faster and easier!
