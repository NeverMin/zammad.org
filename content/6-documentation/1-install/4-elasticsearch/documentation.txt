Title: Setup Elasticsearch
----

Text:

We use Elasticsearch for the awesome search in Zammad.

### Install Elasticsearch & Attachment Plugin

* Install Elasticsearch 2.4 on your Maschine
  https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch (2.4.x)

* Install the Attachment Plugin
```bash
  cd /usr/share/elasticsearch
  bin/plugin install mapper-attachments
```

* Start Elasticsearch
  Depends on your operating system

### Configure Zammad to work with Elasticsearch

```bash
shell> su - zammad
zammad@shell> rails r "Setting.set('es_url', 'http://127.0.0.1:9200')"
```

In certan cases you can also use the following settings (by default not needed)

* Elasticsearch with http basic auth
```bash
zammad@shell> rails r "Setting.set('es_user', 'elasticsearch')"
zammad@shell> rails r "Setting.set('es_password', 'zammad')"
```

* Extra Elasticsearch index name space
```bash
zammad@shell> rails r "Setting.set('es_index', Socket.gethostname + '_zammad')"
```

* Ignore certain file extentions for indexing
```bash
zammad@shell>  rails r "Setting.set('es_attachment_ignore', [ '.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.mpeg', '.mpg', '.mov', '.bin', '.exe', '.box', '.mbox' ] )"
```

* Max attachment size which is used for indexing, default is 50 mb
```bash
zammad@shell> rails r "Setting.set('es_attachment_max_size_in_mb', 50)"
```

### Create Elasticsearch indexes

After you have configured Zammad for using Elasticsearch, you need to rebuild the index by the following command:

```bash
zammad@shell> rake searchindex:rebuild # drop/create/reload
```
