Title: Search Cheat Sheet
----

Text:


Tickets, article (with attachments), users and organizations are indexed per default.

An simple search for all objects can be: "something"

If you want to search for objetcs with certain attributes you can use "attribute: something".

For example: "customer: some name"

With complex searches you can use conditions with () and AND/OR options.

For example: "state: open AND (from:me OR from:somebody else)"

Note: In general you can use elasticsearch queries for search (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html).
