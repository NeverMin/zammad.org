Title: Migration from other ticket systems to Zammad
----

Text:

After installing Zammad, open http://localhost:3000 with your browser and follow the installation wizard.
From there you're able to start migration from OTRS ande Zendesk.

See the Video @ http://days.zammad.org/features/migrator

If you miss this at the beginning you have to use the command line at the moment.

* Stop all Zammad processes and switch Zammad to import mode (no events are fired - e. g. notifications, sending emails, ...)
* rails c
* Setting.set('import_otrs_endpoint', 'http://xxx/otrs/public.pl?Action=ZammadMigrator')
* Setting.set('import_otrs_endpoint_key', 'xxx')
* Setting.set('import_mode', true)
* Import::OTRS.start

After importing, switch Zammad back to non import mode

* Setting.set('import_mode', false)

Done.
