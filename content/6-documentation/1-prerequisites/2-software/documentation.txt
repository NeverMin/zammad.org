If you want to install Zammad, you need the following software prerequisites.

1\. Database Server

Zammad will store all content in an RDSMS. You can choose between the following products.

* MySQL 5.6+
* MariaDB 10.0+
* PostgreSQL 9.1+

Side note: We tend to recommend PostgreSQL. After the last 10 years we picked the best experience.



2\. Ruby Programming Language

Currently we require Ruby 2.3.1 (all required rubygems like ruby on rails are listed in the Gemfile).



3\. Reverse Proxy

In a typical web enviorment today, you use an reverse proxy to deliver the static content of your application.
Only the "expensive" app required http requests are forwarded to the application server.

The following reverse proxies are supported:

* Nginx 1.3+
* Apache 2.2+



4\. Elasticsearch

For excelent search performance we use Elasticsearch. We support Elasticsearch 2.4+.
